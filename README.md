# Powershell-scripts
Hi everyone!
This repository contains powershell scripts that i wrote recently during
a cyber security course im currently attending.
The scripts have the same purpose which is to remotely install a given software
on computers in a given domain.
The first script "MSI software installation script.ps1" is the basic version
which i wrote initially. 
The other scripts are improvements of the initial script
and the "Remote MSI installation Final.ps1" is the final version.

Don't forget to give a start if you like my work!

I hope to upload more scripts in the near future!
