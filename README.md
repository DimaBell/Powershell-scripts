# Powershell-scripts
Hi everyone!
This repository contains two powershell scripts that i wrote recently during
a cyber security course im currently attending.
Both scripts have the same purpose which is to remotely install a given software
on computers in a given domain.
The first script "MSI software installation script.ps1" is the basic version
which i wrote initially and the second script "Remote MSI installation.ps1"
is an improved version of it.

Don't forget to give a start if you like my work!

I hope to upload more scripts in the near future!
